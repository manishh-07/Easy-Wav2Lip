# Easy-Wav2Lip improves Wav2Lip video lipsyncing making it:

## Easier:
* Simple setup and execution - locally and via colab.
     * no messing around manually downloading and installing prerequesits
     * Google Colab has only 2 cells to execute
     * Windows users only need one file to install, update and run.
* Well documented options below.
     * No more wondering what anything does!

## Faster:
For my 9 second 720p 60fps test clip via Colab T4:
| Original Wav2Lip | Easy-Wav2Lip |
|:-------|:-----|
| Execution time: 6m 53s | Execution time: 56s |

That's not a typo! My clip goes from almost 7 minutes to under 1 minute!

The tracking data is saved between generations of the same video, saving even more time:
| Easy-Wav2Lip on the same video again |
|:-----|
| Execution time: 25s |
